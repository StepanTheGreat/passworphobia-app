# Passworphobia
A password manager that doesn't store passwords!

# How?
All your passwords are randomly generated, by using the secret pass-phrase. With this you can achieve very strong, traceless and rememberable passwords.
We also provide you a way to generate a long, strong and unique salt, which will accelerate your password generation unpredictiblity even more (Don't forget
to move the old salt to a new device if you're migrating).

Additionaly featuring a customizable, basic character set and size list for password generation (For some specific websites)

# Building from source
Unfortunately we're not planning on distributing to all linux distros (Currently only planning for debian), so you can clone our project and build it
using tauri and node.js via `npm tauri build`.

# Contribution
This is a private project, so we won't support any push requests. But we'll gladly look at bugs/issues or some minor features.
